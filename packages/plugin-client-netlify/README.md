# Netlify Xata Plugin

The Netlify Xata Plugin enables you to sync your Xata branch with Netlify's deploy previews. This plugin is currently in beta, so please let us know if you have any [feedback](mailto:support@xata.io)!

This plugin depends on the [Xata SDK (Software Development Kit)](https://xata.io/docs/typescript-client/configuration), which is easiest to get started with using the [Xata CLI (Command Line Interface)](https://xata.io/docs/cli/installation).

## Installation

To install this Netlify build plugin, you have two options:

- You can install it via [the Netlify UI (User Interface)](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-plugins/#ui-installation). Here, you can search for "Xata" and install the plugin.

- You can also install it using [file-based plugin installation](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-plugins/#file-based-installation) by referencing the plugin as `netlify-plugin-xata` in your `netlify.toml`.
