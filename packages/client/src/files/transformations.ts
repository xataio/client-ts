   *    of width and height, it will be cropped to fit.
   *  - crop: The image will be shrunk and cropped to fit within the area
   *    specified by width and height. The image will not be enlarged. For images
   *    smaller than the given dimensions it's the same as scale-down. For
   *    images larger than the given dimensions, it's the same as cover.

   *    height, and then fills the remaining area with a background color
