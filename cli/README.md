# Command Line Interface (CLI)

Xata provides a CLI as a convenience for developers. It is intended to provide feature parity with Xata's [Web UI](https://xata.io/docs/getting-started/web-ui) (User Interface) to enable developers to build applications at **rapid pace** with **as little friction as possible**.

You can find the CLI documentation [here](https://xata.io/docs/getting-started/cli).
